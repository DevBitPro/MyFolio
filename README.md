# My Personal Portfolio - Backend Implementation In Progress

## Introduction

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project aims to provide an online platform for me to showcase my professional journey, skills, and projects to potential employers, clients, and collaborators. While the frontend design and layout are already in place, I'm actively working on implementing the backend functionalities to make this portfolio even more dynamic and interactive.

## Features

Here are some of the key features and sections of my personal portfolio:

- **About Me:** A brief introduction to who I am and my background.
- **Portfolio:** A showcase of my projects with descriptions and links.
- **Skills:** An overview of the skills and technologies I have expertise in.
- **Contact:** Contact information and a form for easy communication.
- **Blog (Coming Soon):** A section where I'll share my thoughts and experiences.

As I continue to work on the backend, I plan to add features like dynamic project updates, blog functionality, and more.

## Technologies Used

The static portion of this website has been built using the following technologies:

- **HTML5:** For structuring the content of web pages.
