                                    Dec 2022]
                                <p>RocketDocs PMAPS Proposal Platform.</p>
                                <p>>>Actively participated in backlog grooming sessions and attended story development
                                    entry and exit review meetings with developers. Reviewed pull requests (PRs) to
                                    understand user stories and collaborated with the business analyst to understand
                                    refined acceptance criteria, addressing any QA understanding gaps to ensure
                                    alignment with the validation and test development process.</p>
                                <p>>>Developed and implemented end-to-end automation using Cypress, focusing on RFP
                                    database and proposal management workflow scenarios. Designed test scripts to ensure
                                    seamless execution across multiple environments, including development, testing,
                                    staging, and production. Integrated Cucumber.js for BDD, enabling validation of
                                    features across RFP database and proposal management workflows tailored to
                                    end-client module requirements.</p>
                                <p>>>Closely work with development teams to identify and resolve root causes of bugs.
                                    Built an automated smoke and end-to-end (E2E) test suite from scratch, migrating
                                    legacy tests from Java to JavaScript using Cypress, Node.js, and Mocha.js. Enhanced
                                    functionality and execution speed by integrating various NPM libraries, achieving
                                    broader test coverage, and optimizing the automation validation process.</p>
                                <p>>>Executed and monitored smoke and end-to-end (E2E) tests in the local development
                                    environment, triggered to verify each story's build and pull request (PR) for
                                    specific module enhancements or new features to validate changes before merging into
                                    the master branch, ensuring robust testing coverage, intact existing functionality,
                                    and no new bugs introduced.
                                </p>
                                <p>>>Routinely executed smoke tests across staging and production environments on every
                                    release date in each sprint to ensure stability and functionality. Developed and
                                    maintained automated test scripts for new and enhanced front-end features introduced
                                    in each sprint to maximize test coverage.</p>
                                <p>>>Configured Okta authentication environment variables for end-to-end and API testing
                                    to securely manage credentials. Developed custom commands (loginByOkta and
                                    loginByOktaApi) to authenticate with Okta. Utilized cy.origin() for UI login
                                    workflows and cy.session() for maintaining session persistence. Integrated the Okta
                                    Auth SDK for programmatic login and dynamically managed localStorage during tests.
                                    Adapted the React front-end with the Okta React SDK and secured back-end APIs using
                                    the Okta JWT Verifier to ensure robust and reliable authentication.</p>
                                <p>>>Implemented Cypress features to manage and reduce test flakiness in end-to-end
                                    (E2E) and API testing caused by environmental factors, race conditions, and test
                                    logic bugs. Utilized debugging tools such as cy.debug() and cy.pause(), improved
                                    test resilience by using custom selectors with data-cy attributes, and replaced
                                    fixed-time waits (cy.wait()) with accurate, dynamic assertions.</p>
                                <p>>>Successfully implemented and optimized Bitbucket Pipelines for efficient CI/CD
                                    workflows, integrating Cypress for robust end-to-end testing. Configured
                                    cross-browser test execution using Docker images for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge, and
                                    used caching strategies to streamline dependencies and build artifacts. Designed and
                                    executed parallelized workflows with Cypress Cloud to enhance test performance
                                    through intelligent load balancing and grouped test runs. Utilized Cypress Cloud for
                                    recording test results, generating comprehensive reports, identifying flaky tests,
                                    and integrating testing into pull request processes with automated status checks and
                                    notifications. Created reusable YAML configurations for streamlined installation and
                                    worker jobs, ensuring efficient test execution and capturing key artifacts like
                                    screenshots and videos for enhanced debugging and reporting. </p>
                                <p>>>Effectively logged and tracked both new and existing defects in Jira and
                                    Confluence, identified through comprehensive manual and automated testing across
                                    specific software versions with detailed documentation, including reproducible
                                    steps, affected versions, and critical root cause analysis, to ensure clear
                                    communication and efficient resolution of issues.</p>
