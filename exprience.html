                                <p class="mb-0 opacity-75">***Performed a range of essential testing activities to ensure
                                    that our products meet the highest quality standards. This includes defining testing
                                    requirements, developing test strategies, generating test reports, and creating test
                                    matrices. I actively participated in story review meetings and collaborated with
                                    team members to ensure that testing was progressing as planned.</p>
                                <p class="mb-0 opacity-75">***Using Atlassian Confluence/Jira management tool, I
                                    meticulously documented test cases, test execution, defect/regression tracking, and
                                    other QA activities. I conducted various types of testing, including manual,
                                    functional, regression, positive, and negative testing during each sprint and
                                    release cycle. Additionally, I refactored and executed legacy regression suites for
                                    applications under test using the page object model and method correlating,
                                    chaining, binding, expanding overloading process, overriding process, and follow-up
                                    automated deployment. I tested Angular applications with the Protractor wrapper
                                    integrated with Selenium Web Driver.</p>
                                <p class="mb-0 opacity-75">***After code merges into the test environment, I conducted
                                    local regression for legacy suites and used multiple virtual machines for automation
                                    execution simultaneously to trigger multiple environments. I also conducted backend
                                    database store procedure tests using the Rest-Assured Java library with JUnit4. I
                                    created a test suite and executed it with assertion, property content, object
                                    modifier match, and debugging. To ensure that tests were updated or refactored based
                                    on new changes or enhancements to the system, I maintained QA automation maintenance
                                    Jira board tickets, in addition to existing ones. I conducted sprint ticket review
                                    meetings closely with the business analyst and developer and installed the dev
                                    environment for testing locally to emulate the end-client environment. I managed bug
                                    tracking and provided informative updates as requested. I monitored the CI/CD
                                    platform Jenkins for Automation e2e test build and reviewed automation test PR
                                    branch to ensure it met A/C coverage. Additionally, I conducted development PR
                                    review and local checkout branch, and ran the test against the PR branch to ensure
                                    that new features worked as expected. I attended backlog refinement each sprint and
                                    tracked possible new auto candidates from new story tickets that had been developed.
                                    I reviewed new automation candidate test steps with a QA manager and other team
                                    members to ensure that there were no gaps within auto test coverage.</p>
                                <p class="mb-0 opacity-75">***As part of my responsibilities, I was tasked with preparing
                                    high-level scenarios based on Agile methodologies for each Scrum and developing a
                                    comprehensive test plan that included traceability metrics mapping with requirements
                                    and test cases. To execute load testing, I utilized LoadRunner to develop load test
                                    scripts for the entire site. In order to simulate realistic user behavior, I
                                    performed parameterization, pacing, and correlation. Moreover, I set the runtime
                                    settings in LoadRunner and correlated dynamically created session data to
                                    synchronize with the application on Web-HTTP/HTML protocol.</p>
                                <p class="mb-0 opacity-75">***For data-driven testing, I employed Win Runner to extract
                                    data from a table. To assess the performance, stress, and load conditions of the
                                    application, I utilized LoadRunner's performance monitor. Additionally, I developed
                                    load/stress scenarios for performance testing using LoadRunner Controller and
                                    configured monitor Memory Utilization, CPU Utilization, Throughput, and Network
                                    Connections, among other metrics.</p>
                                <p class="mb-0 opacity-75">***To conduct performance testing, I created Java VUsers using
                                    VuGen and executed Load, Volume, Stress, and Endurance testing. The main objective
                                    was to verify that the application's performance did not degrade with increased user
                                    load, ensure that the application met exit criteria for response times, and
                                    establish the application's stability for the long duration of testing. Any bugs
                                    identified were tracked and updated in the defect tracking tool JIRA.</p>
                                <p class="mb-0 opacity-75">***During Load testing, I monitored the VUsers logs, web
                                    resources, and transaction response times, and analyzed various graphs, including
                                    Database Resource graphs, Network Monitor graphs, User Graphs, Error Graphs,
                                    Transaction graphs, site scope, and Web Server Resource Graphs. In order to provide
                                    detailed analysis, I created performance test analysis reports that included graphs
                                    and identified application bottlenecks for various transactions.</p>
                                <p class="mb-0 opacity-75">***Coordinated with project managers and
                                    stakeholders to plan and execute performance testing activities, such as load
                                    testing, stress testing, and endurance testing. I created and maintained test plans
                                    and test scripts for performance testing and created performance test reports and
                                    dashboards using performance testing tools such as JIRA.</p>

                                <p class="mb-0 opacity-75">***In the project, I played a crucial role in the creation of
                                    a comprehensive database that documented test defects and procedures. This was
                                    necessary to ensure compliance with standards and accurate replication of test
                                    scenarios. Additionally, I designed and implemented automated testing tools and
                                    programs that addressed various areas, including database impacts, software
                                    scenarios, regression testing, negative testing, error/bug retests, and usability.
                                </p>
                                <p class="mb-0 opacity-75">***Moreover, I documented the root causes of software defects
                                    and reported issues related to program functionality, output, online screen, and
                                    content to software developers. I delivered thorough QA testing reports that
                                    determined the quality of the product and readiness for release. To maximize the
                                    verification coverage of system variables, I wrote test plans, scenarios, scripts,
                                    and cases based on various documentation, including requirements, vision, use-case,
                                    and user help/tutorial documentation.</p>
                                <p class="mb-0 opacity-75">***In addition, I analyzed business manuals and requirements
                                    documents to summarize system-specific business rules and other operating
                                    conditions. I performed end-to-end testing on legacy applications and ad-hoc testing
                                    at the beginning of each sprint. I participated in design enhancement reviews and
                                    submitted progress reports on the testing effort. I also refactored existing code
                                    and enhanced the end-to-end method and test scope based on software gradual
                                    development.</p>
                                <p class="mb-0 opacity-75">***To detect, report, and classify bugs, I used Jira and
                                    Atlassian Confluence. I maintained and executed legacy regression suites for
                                    applications under test using the page object model and method correlating,
                                    chaining, binding, expanding overloading process, overriding process, and follow-up
                                    automated deployment. I performed end-client-UI testing with the TestNG framework
                                    integrated with Selenium Web Driver. Moreover, I implemented tests with data-driven
                                    and keyword-driven testing using Web Driver in Selenium.</p>
                                <p class="mb-0 opacity-75">***To ensure smooth collaboration with developers, I
                                    communicated any defects encountered during regression tests and worked with them
                                    until all issues were resolved. Additionally, I tested applications on cloud
                                    simulators such as IOS and Android devices on the cloud platform (Browser Stack) and
                                    implemented Appium scripts to test IOS and Android platforms. I also implemented UI
                                    Automation viewer in Appium to inspect elements in mobile applications and write
                                    scripts. Furthermore, I enhanced and performed testing on various mobile devices
                                    with different platforms such as IOS and Android.</p>
                                <p class="mb-0 opacity-75">***Responsible for gathering business requirements, studying

                                    to develop Vuser Scripts using Web-HTTP/HTML and Citrix ICA Protocols. I also
                                    designed and executed Benchmark, Stress, and Endurance Testing, and parameterized
                                    large and complex test data to accurately depict production trends. To ensure the
                                    accuracy of the results, I validated the scripts to make sure they were executed
                                    correctly and met the scenario description.</p>
                                <p class="mb-0 opacity-75">***Using LoadRunner Analysis tool and log files, I analyzed
                                    the results and identified performance issues in the application and its components.
                                    I was also responsible for optimizing server configurations to improve the
                                    application's performance under heavier loads. In addition, I maintained the test
                                    matrix and bug database and generated monthly reports to track progress.
                                    â¢ As part of my responsibilities, I conducted memory leak testing for all
                                    applications using LoadRunner and prepared huge data for parameterized values in the
                                    scripts for multiple scenarios. I customized scripts according to business
                                    specifications using LoadRunner and used both manual and automated correlations to
                                    parameterize dynamically changing parameters.
                                </p>
                                <p class="mb-0 opacity-75">***To conduct performance testing, I created virtual users

                                    scenarios using LoadRunner and monitored system resources such as CPU utilization,
                                    throughput, HTTP responses per second, retries per second, connection per section,
                                    hit per second, and page per second. By doing this, I ensured that the application
                                    met the required performance standards and was able to handle a large number of
                                    users.</p>
